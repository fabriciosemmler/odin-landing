# Project: Landing Page

## Let's practice CSS

The current project is part of the Foundations Course of **The Odin Project**. 
It is about constructing a simple web page using HTML and CSS.
The main skills demonstrated are HTML containers, CSS elements and CSS Flexbox.
Feel free to make critics so I can improve as a web developer. Thanks in advance!
